ResNet-18 using PyTorch on Chest X-ray dataset

1) Implementation of ResNet-18 from scratch
   
2) Using a pre-trained ResNet-18
   
   a) Using the pre-trained network for classification by retraining only the newly added classifier part

   b) Fine-tuning the pre-trained ResNet-18
   
3) Modifying the ResNet-18 model architecture
   
   a) Modifying the original ResNet-18 into ResNet-14 and training from scratch
   
   b) Modifying the pre-trained ResNet-18 and fine-tuning
